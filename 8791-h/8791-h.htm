<h2>CANTO V</h2>
<br>

<p>Now had I left those spirits, and pursued<br>
The steps of my Conductor, when beheld<br>
Pointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:<br>
"See how it seems as if the light not shone<br>
From the left hand of him beneath, and he,<br>
As living, seems to be led on." &nbsp;Mine eyes<br>
I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze<br>
Through wonder first at me, and then at me<br>
And the light broken underneath, by turns.<br>
"Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?" &nbsp;my guide<br>
Exclaim'd, "that thou hast slack'd thy pace? &nbsp;or how<br>
Imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?<br>
Come after me, and to their babblings leave<br>
The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,<br>
Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!<br>
He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,<br>
Still of his aim is wide, in that the one<br>
Sicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other could I answer save "I come?"<br>
I said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd<br>
Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,<br>
A little way before us, some who sang<br>
The "Miserere" in responsive Strains.<br>
When they perceiv'd that through my body I<br>
Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song<br>
Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;<br>
And two of them, in guise of messengers,<br>
Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:<br>
"Of your condition we would gladly learn."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them my guide. &nbsp;"Ye may return, and bear<br>
Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame<br>
Is real flesh. &nbsp;If, as I deem, to view<br>
His shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them.<br>
Him let them honour, they may prize him well."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed<br>
Cut through the serene air at fall of night,<br>
Nor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,<br>
That upward these did not in shorter space<br>
Return; and, there arriving, with the rest<br>
Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-42.jpg"><img alt="05-42th.jpg (38K)" src="images/05-42th.jpg" height="477" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many," exclaim'd the bard, "are these, who throng<br>
Around us: to petition thee they come.<br>
Go therefore on, and listen as thou go'st."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness<br>
With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth."<br>
Shouting they came, "a little rest thy step.<br>
Look if thou any one amongst our tribe<br>
Hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there<br>
Thou mayst report. &nbsp;Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?<br>
Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? &nbsp;We all<br>
By violence died, and to our latest hour<br>
Were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,<br>
So that, repenting and forgiving, we<br>
Did issue out of life at peace with God,<br>
Who with desire to see him fills our heart."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I: "The visages of all I scan<br>
Yet none of ye remember. &nbsp;But if aught,<br>
That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!<br>
Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,<br>
Which on the steps of guide so excellent<br>
Following from world to world intent I seek."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer he began: "None here distrusts<br>
Thy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;<br>
So as the will fail not for want of power.<br>
Whence I, who sole before the others speak,<br>
Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,<br>
Which lies between Romagna and the realm<br>
Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray<br>
Those who inhabit Fano, that for me<br>
Their adorations duly be put up,<br>
By which I may purge off my grievous sins.<br>
From thence I came. &nbsp;But the deep passages,<br>
Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,<br>
Upon my bosom in Antenor's land<br>
Were made, where to be more secure I thought.<br>
The author of the deed was Este's prince,<br>
Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath<br>
Pursued me. &nbsp;Had I towards Mira fled,<br>
When overta'en at Oriaco, still<br>
Might I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,<br>
And in the mire and rushes tangled there<br>
Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said another: "Ah! so may the wish,<br>
That takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,<br>
As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.<br>
Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:<br>
Giovanna nor none else have care for me,<br>
Sorrowing with these I therefore go." &nbsp;I thus:<br>
"From Campaldino's field what force or chance<br>
Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" &nbsp;answer'd he, "at Casentino's foot<br>
A stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung<br>
In Apennine above the Hermit's seat.<br>
E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,<br>
Pierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,<br>
And bloodying the plain. &nbsp;Here sight and speech<br>
Fail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name<br>
I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.<br>
I will report the truth; which thou again<br>
Tell to the living. &nbsp;Me God's angel took,<br>
Whilst he of hell exclaim'd: "O thou from heav'n!<br>
Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me? &nbsp;Thou of him<br>
Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away<br>
For one poor tear that he deprives me of.<br>
But of the other, other rule I make."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects<br>
That vapour dank, returning into water,<br>
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.<br>
That evil will, which in his intellect<br>
Still follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind<br>
And smoky mist, by virtue of the power<br>
Given by his nature. &nbsp;Thence the valley, soon<br>
As day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud<br>
From Pratomagno to the mountain range,<br>
And stretch'd the sky above, so that the air<br>
Impregnate chang'd to water. &nbsp;Fell the rain,<br>
And to the fosses came all that the land<br>
Contain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,<br>
To the great river with such headlong sweep<br>
Rush'd, that nought stay'd its course. &nbsp;My stiffen'd frame<br>
Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,<br>
And dash'd it into Arno, from my breast<br>
Loos'ning the cross, that of myself I made<br>
When overcome with pain. &nbsp;He hurl'd me on,<br>
Along the banks and bottom of his course;<br>
Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt."<br>

<br><br><br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,<br>
And rested after thy long road," so spake<br>
Next the third spirit; "then remember me.<br>
I once was Pia. &nbsp;Sienna gave me life,<br>
Maremma took it from me. &nbsp;That he knows,<br>
Who me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd."</p>

<h2>CANTO VI</h2>
<br>

<p>When from their game of dice men separate,<br>
He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,<br>
Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws<br>
He cast: but meanwhile all the company<br>
Go with the other; one before him runs,<br>
And one behind his mantle twitches, one<br>
Fast by his side bids him remember him.<br>
He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand<br>
Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;<br>
And thus he from the press defends himself.<br>
E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;<br>
And turning so my face around to all,<br>
And promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell<br>
By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,<br>
Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.<br>
Here Frederic Novello, with his hand<br>
Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,<br>
Who put the good Marzuco to such proof<br>
Of constancy. &nbsp;Count Orso I beheld;<br>
And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite<br>
And envy, as it said, but for no crime:<br>
I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,<br>
While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant<br>
Let her beware; lest for so false a deed<br>
She herd with worse than these. When I was freed<br>
From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers<br>
To hasten on their state of blessedness;<br>
Straight I began: "O thou, my luminary!<br>
It seems expressly in thy text denied,<br>
That heaven's supreme decree can never bend<br>
To supplication; yet with this design<br>
Do these entreat. &nbsp;Can then their hope be vain,<br>
Or is thy saying not to me reveal'd?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thus to me: "Both what I write is plain,<br>
And these deceiv'd not in their hope, if well<br>
Thy mind consider, that the sacred height<br>
Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame<br>
In a short moment all fulfils, which he<br>
Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.<br>
Besides, when I this point concluded thus,<br>
By praying no defect could be supplied;<br>
Because the pray'r had none access to God.<br>
Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not<br>
Contented unless she assure thee so,<br>
Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.<br>
I know not if thou take me right; I mean<br>
Beatrice. &nbsp;Her thou shalt behold above,<br>
Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I: "Sir! let us mend our speed; for now<br>
I tire not as before; and lo! the hill<br>
Stretches its shadow far." &nbsp;He answer'd thus:<br>
"Our progress with this day shall be as much<br>
As we may now dispatch; but otherwise<br>
Than thou supposest is the truth. &nbsp;For there<br>
Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold<br>
Him back returning, who behind the steep<br>
Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam<br>
Thou dost not break. &nbsp;But lo! a spirit there<br>
Stands solitary, and toward us looks:<br>
It will instruct us in the speediest way."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We soon approach'd it. &nbsp;O thou Lombard spirit!<br>
How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,<br>
Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!<br>
It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,<br>
Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.<br>
But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,<br>
Requesting it to show the best ascent.<br>
It answer to his question none return'd,<br>
But of our country and our kind of life<br>
Demanded. &nbsp;When my courteous guide began,<br>
"Mantua," the solitary shadow quick<br>
Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,<br>
And cry'd, "Mantuan! I am thy countryman<br>
Sordello." &nbsp;Each the other then embrac'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,<br>
Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,<br>
Lady no longer of fair provinces,<br>
But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,<br>
Ev'n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land<br>
Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen<br>
With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones<br>
In thee abide not without war; and one<br>
Malicious gnaws another, ay of those<br>
Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,<br>
Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;<br>
Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark<br>
If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.<br>
What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand<br>
Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?<br>
Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.<br>
Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,<br>
And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,<br>
If well thou marked'st that which God commands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look how that beast to felness hath relaps'd<br>
From having lost correction of the spur,<br>
Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,<br>
O German Albert! who abandon'st her,<br>
That is grown savage and unmanageable,<br>
When thou should'st clasp her flanks with forked heels.<br>
Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!<br>
And be it strange and manifest to all!<br>
Such as may strike thy successor with dread!<br>
For that thy sire and thou have suffer'd thus,<br>
Through greediness of yonder realms detain'd,<br>
The garden of the empire to run waste.<br>
Come see the Capulets and Montagues,<br>
The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man<br>
Who car'st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these<br>
With dire suspicion rack'd. Come, cruel one!<br>
Come and behold the' oppression of the nobles,<br>
And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.<br>
What safety Santafiore can supply.<br>
Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,<br>
Desolate widow! day and night with moans:<br>
"My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?"<br>
Come and behold what love among thy people:<br>
And if no pity touches thee for us,<br>
Come and blush for thine own report. &nbsp;For me,<br>
If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,<br>
Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!<br>
Are thy just eyes turn'd elsewhere? &nbsp;or is this<br>
A preparation in the wond'rous depth<br>
Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,<br>
Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?<br>
So are the' Italian cities all o'erthrong'd<br>
With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made<br>
Of every petty factious villager.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov'd<br>
At this digression, which affects not thee:<br>
Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed.<br>
Many have justice in their heart, that long<br>
Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,<br>
Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine<br>
Have it on their lip's edge. &nbsp;Many refuse<br>
To bear the common burdens: readier thine<br>
Answer uneall'd, and cry, "Behold I stoop!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,<br>
Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!<br>
Facts best witness if I speak the truth.<br>
Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old<br>
Enacted laws, for civil arts renown'd,<br>
Made little progress in improving life<br>
Tow'rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,<br>
That to the middle of November scarce<br>
Reaches the thread thou in October weav'st.<br>
How many times, within thy memory,<br>
Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices<br>
Have been by thee renew'd, and people chang'd!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou remember'st well and can'st see clear,<br>
Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,<br>
Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft<br>
Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain.</p>

<h2>CANTO VII</h2>
<br>

<p>After their courteous greetings joyfully<br>
Sev'n times exchang'd, Sordello backward drew<br>
Exclaiming, "Who are ye?" &nbsp;"Before this mount<br>
By spirits worthy of ascent to God<br>
Was sought, my bones had by Octavius' care<br>
Been buried. &nbsp;I am Virgil, for no sin<br>
Depriv'd of heav'n, except for lack of faith."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So answer'd him in few my gentle guide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one, who aught before him suddenly<br>
Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries<br>
"It is yet is not," wav'ring in belief;<br>
Such he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes,<br>
And drawing near with reverential step,<br>
Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp<br>
His lord. &nbsp;"Glory of Latium!" he exclaim'd,<br>
"In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd!<br>
Boast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert<br>
Of mine, what favour rather undeserv'd,<br>
Shows thee to me? &nbsp;If I to hear that voice<br>
Am worthy, say if from below thou com'st<br>
And from what cloister's pale?"&mdash;"Through every orb<br>
Of that sad region," he reply'd, "thus far<br>
Am I arriv'd, by heav'nly influence led<br>
And with such aid I come. &nbsp;There is a place<br>
There underneath, not made by torments sad,<br>
But by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice<br>
Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-21.jpg"><img alt="07-21th.jpg (40K)" src="images/07-21th.jpg" height="477" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


There I with little innocents abide,<br>
Who by death's fangs were bitten, ere exempt<br>
From human taint. &nbsp;There I with those abide,<br>
Who the three holy virtues put not on,<br>
But understood the rest, and without blame<br>
Follow'd them all. &nbsp;But if thou know'st and canst,<br>
Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,<br>
Where Purgatory its true beginning takes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answer'd thus: "We have no certain place<br>
Assign'd us: upwards I may go or round,<br>
Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide.<br>
But thou beholdest now how day declines:<br>
And upwards to proceed by night, our power<br>
Excels: therefore it may be well to choose<br>
A place of pleasant sojourn. &nbsp;To the right<br>
Some spirits sit apart retir'd. &nbsp;If thou<br>
Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:<br>
And thou wilt know them, not without delight."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How chances this?" &nbsp;was answer'd; "who so wish'd<br>
To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd<br>
By other, or through his own weakness fail?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Sordello then, along the ground<br>
Trailing his finger, spoke: "Only this line<br>
Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun<br>
Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes<br>
Thy going upwards, save the shades of night.<br>
These with the wont of power perplex the will.<br>
With them thou haply mightst return beneath,<br>
Or to and fro around the mountain's side<br>
Wander, while day is in the horizon shut."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,<br>
Exclaim'd: "Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,<br>
That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little space we were remov'd from thence,<br>
When I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.<br>
Ev'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That way," the' escorting spirit cried, "we go,<br>
Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:<br>
And thou await renewal of the day."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path<br>
Led us traverse into the ridge's side,<br>
Where more than half the sloping edge expires.<br>
Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin'd,<br>
And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood<br>
Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds<br>
But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers<br>
Plac'd in that fair recess, in color all<br>
Had been surpass'd, as great surpasses less.<br>
Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,<br>
But of the sweetness of a thousand smells<br>
A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-82.jpg"><img alt="07-82th.jpg (43K)" src="images/07-82th.jpg" height="477" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salve Regina," on the grass and flowers<br>
Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit<br>
Who not beyond the valley could be seen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,"<br>
Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.<br>
For from this eminence ye shall discern<br>
Better the acts and visages of all,<br>
Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.<br>
He, who sits high above the rest, and seems<br>
To have neglected that he should have done,<br>
And to the others' song moves not his lip,<br>
The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd<br>
The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,<br>
So that by others she revives but slowly,<br>
He, who with kindly visage comforts him,<br>
Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,<br>
That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe<br>
Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:<br>
Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth<br>
Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,<br>
Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.<br>
And that one with the nose depress, who close<br>
In counsel seems with him of gentle look,<br>
Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.<br>
Look there how he doth knock against his breast!<br>
The other ye behold, who for his cheek<br>
Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.<br>
They are the father and the father-in-law<br>
Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know<br>
And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps<br>
In song, with him of feature prominent,<br>
With ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.<br>
And if that stripling who behinds him sits,<br>
King after him had liv'd, his virtue then<br>
From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;<br>
Which may not of the other heirs be said.<br>
By James and Frederick his realms are held;<br>
Neither the better heritage obtains.<br>
Rarely into the branches of the tree<br>
Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains<br>
He who bestows it, that as his free gift<br>
It may be call'd. &nbsp;To Charles my words apply<br>
No less than to his brother in the song;<br>
Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.<br>
So much that plant degenerates from its seed,<br>
As more than Beatrice and Margaret<br>
Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold the king of simple life and plain,<br>
Harry of England, sitting there alone:<br>
He through his branches better issue spreads.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That one, who on the ground beneath the rest<br>
Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,<br>
Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause<br>
The deed of Alexandria and his war<br>
Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep."</p>

<h2>CANTO VIII</h2>
<br>

<p>Now was the hour that wakens fond desire<br>
In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,<br>
Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,<br>
And pilgrim newly on his road with love<br>
Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,<br>
That seems to mourn for the expiring day:<br>
When I, no longer taking heed to hear<br>
Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark<br>
One risen from its seat, which with its hand<br>
Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,<br>
Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,<br>
As telling God, "I care for naught beside."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Te Lucis Ante," so devoutly then<br>
Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,<br>
That all my sense in ravishment was lost.<br>
And the rest after, softly and devout,<br>
Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze<br>
Directed to the bright supernal wheels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:<br>
For of so subtle texture is this veil,<br>
That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that gentle band silently next<br>
Look up, as if in expectation held,<br>
Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high<br>
I saw forth issuing descend beneath<br>
Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,<br>
Broken and mutilated at their points.<br>
Green as the tender leaves but newly born,<br>
Their vesture was, the which by wings as green<br>
Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.<br>
A little over us one took his stand,<br>
The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,<br>
So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;<br>
But in their visages the dazzled eye<br>
Was lost, as faculty that by too much<br>
Is overpower'd. &nbsp;"From Mary's bosom both<br>
Are come," exclaim'd Sordello, "as a guard<br>
Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,<br>
The serpent." &nbsp;Whence, not knowing by which path<br>
He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,<br>
All frozen, to my leader's trusted side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sordello paus'd not: "To the valley now<br>
(For it is time) let us descend; and hold<br>
Converse with those great shadows: haply much<br>
Their sight may please ye." &nbsp;Only three steps down<br>
Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,<br>
And noted one who look'd as with desire<br>
To know me. &nbsp;Time was now that air arrow dim;<br>
Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine<br>
It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.<br>
Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.<br>
Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,<br>
When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No salutation kind on either part<br>
Was left unsaid. &nbsp;He then inquir'd: "How long<br>
Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,<br>
Over the distant waves?"&mdash;"O!" answer'd I,<br>
"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,<br>
And still in my first life, thus journeying on,<br>
The other strive to gain." &nbsp;Soon as they heard<br>
My words, he and Sordello backward drew,<br>
As suddenly amaz'd. &nbsp;To Virgil one,<br>
The other to a spirit turn'd, who near<br>
Was seated, crying: "Conrad! up with speed:<br>
Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd."<br>
Then turning round to me: "By that rare mark<br>
Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides<br>
So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,<br>
When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.<br>
Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call<br>
There, where reply to innocence is made.<br>
Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;<br>
Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,<br>
Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.<br>
By her it easily may be perceiv'd,<br>
How long in women lasts the flame of love,<br>
If sight and touch do not relume it oft.<br>
For her so fair a burial will not make<br>
The viper which calls Milan to the field,<br>
As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp<br>
Of that right seal, which with due temperature<br>
Glows in the bosom. &nbsp;My insatiate eyes<br>
Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there<br>
Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel<br>
Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:<br>
"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answer'd: "The three torches, with which here<br>
The pole is all on fire." &nbsp;He then to me:<br>
"The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn<br>
Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet he spoke. &nbsp;Sordello to himself<br>
Drew him, and cry'd: "Lo there our enemy!"<br>
And with his hand pointed that way to look.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the side, where barrier none arose<br>
Around the little vale, a serpent lay,<br>
Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.<br>
Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake<br>
Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;<br>
And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,<br>
Licking his hack. &nbsp;I saw not, nor can tell,<br>
How those celestial falcons from their seat<br>
Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,<br>
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.<br>
The serpent fled; and to their stations back<br>
The angels up return'd with equal flight.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/frontispiece.jpg"><img alt="front2.jpg (41K)" src="images/front2.jpg" height="477" width="431"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,<br>
Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,<br>
Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,<br>
Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,<br>
As may suffice thee to the enamel's height."<br>
It thus began: "If any certain news<br>
Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part<br>
Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there<br>
They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not<br>
That old one, but from him I sprang. &nbsp;The love<br>
I bore my people is now here refin'd."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your dominions," I answer'd, "ne'er was I.<br>
But through all Europe where do those men dwell,<br>
To whom their glory is not manifest?<br>
The fame, that honours your illustrious house,<br>
Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;<br>
So that he knows it who was never there.<br>
I swear to you, so may my upward route<br>
Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs<br>
The value of her coffer and her sword.<br>
Nature and use give her such privilege,<br>
That while the world is twisted from his course<br>
By a bad head, she only walks aright,<br>
And has the evil way in scorn." &nbsp;He then:<br>
"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun<br>
Revisits not the couch, which with four feet<br>
The forked Aries covers, ere that kind<br>
Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain<br>
With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,<br>
If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd."</p>

<h2>CANTO IX</h2>

<br><br>
<a href="images/09-1.jpg"><img alt="09-1th.jpg (28K)" src="images/09-1th.jpg" height="458" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,<br>
Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,<br>
Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,<br>
Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign<br>
Of that chill animal, who with his train<br>
Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,<br>
Two steps of her ascent the night had past,<br>
And now the third was closing up its wing,<br>
When I, who had so much of Adam with me,<br>
Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,<br>
There where all five were seated. &nbsp;In that hour,<br>
When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,<br>
Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,<br>
And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,<br>
And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full<br>
Of holy divination in their dreams,<br>
Then in a vision did I seem to view<br>
A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,<br>
With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,<br>
And I was in that place, methought, from whence<br>
Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,<br>
Was snatch'd aloft to the high consistory.<br>
"Perhaps," thought I within me, "here alone<br>
He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains<br>
To pounce upon the prey." &nbsp;Therewith, it seem'd,<br>
A little wheeling in his airy tour<br>
Terrible as the lightning rush'd he down,<br>
And snatch'd me upward even to the fire.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-29.jpg"><img alt="09-29th.jpg (42K)" src="images/09-29th.jpg" height="477" width="438"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


There both, I thought, the eagle and myself<br>
Did burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,<br>
That needs my sleep was broken off. &nbsp;As erst<br>
Achilles shook himself, and round him roll'd<br>
His waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,<br>
Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled<br>
To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;<br>
E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face<br>
The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,<br>
Like one ice-struck with dread. &nbsp;Solo at my side<br>
My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now<br>
More than two hours aloft: and to the sea<br>
My looks were turn'd. &nbsp;"Fear not," my master cried,<br>
"Assur'd we are at happy point. &nbsp;Thy strength<br>
Shrink not, but rise dilated. &nbsp;Thou art come<br>
To Purgatory now. &nbsp;Lo! there the cliff<br>
That circling bounds it! &nbsp;Lo! the entrance there,<br>
Where it doth seem disparted!  Ere the dawn<br>
Usher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul<br>
Slept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath<br>
A lady came, and thus bespake me: I<br>
Am Lucia. &nbsp;Suffer me to take this man,<br>
Who slumbers. &nbsp;Easier so his way shall speed."<br>
Sordello and the other gentle shapes<br>
Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,<br>
This summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps.<br>
Here did she place thee. &nbsp;First her lovely eyes<br>
That open entrance show'd me; then at once<br>
She vanish'd with thy sleep." &nbsp;Like one, whose doubts<br>
Are chas'd by certainty, and terror turn'd<br>
To comfort on discovery of the truth,<br>
Such was the change in me: and as my guide<br>
Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff<br>
He mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,<br>
Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully<br>
I prop the structure!  Nearer now we drew,<br>
Arriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach<br>
As of a wall appear'd, I could descry<br>
A portal, and three steps beneath, that led<br>
For inlet there, of different colour each,<br>
And one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.<br>
As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,<br>
I mark'd him seated on the highest step,<br>
In visage such, as past my power to bear.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-74.jpg"><img alt="09-74th.jpg (41K)" src="images/09-74th.jpg" height="541" width="429"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Grasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back<br>
The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain<br>
My sight directed. &nbsp;"Speak from whence ye stand:"<br>
He cried: "What would ye? &nbsp;Where is your escort?<br>
Take heed your coming upward harm ye not."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,"<br>
Replied the' instructor, "told us, even now,<br>
'Pass that way: here the gate is."&mdash;"And may she<br>
Befriending prosper your ascent," resum'd<br>
The courteous keeper of the gate: "Come then<br>
Before our steps." &nbsp;We straightway thither came.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest stair was marble white so smooth<br>
And polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form<br>
Distinct I saw. &nbsp;The next of hue more dark<br>
Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,<br>
Crack'd lengthwise and across. &nbsp;The third, that lay<br>
Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that flam'd<br>
Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.<br>
On this God's angel either foot sustain'd,<br>
Upon the threshold seated, which appear'd<br>
A rock of diamond. &nbsp;Up the trinal steps<br>
My leader cheerily drew me. &nbsp;"Ask," said he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piously at his holy feet devolv'd<br>
I cast me, praying him for pity's sake<br>
That he would open to me: but first fell<br>
Thrice on my bosom prostrate. &nbsp;Seven times<br>
The letter, that denotes the inward stain,<br>
He on my forehead with the blunted point<br>
Of his drawn sword inscrib'd. &nbsp;And "Look," he cried,<br>
"When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground,<br>
Were of one colour with the robe he wore.<br>
From underneath that vestment forth he drew<br>
Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,<br>
Its fellow silver. &nbsp;With the pallid first,<br>
And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,<br>
As to content me well. &nbsp;"Whenever one<br>
Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight<br>
It turn not, to this alley then expect<br>
Access in vain." &nbsp;Such were the words he spake.<br>
"One is more precious: but the other needs<br>
Skill and sagacity, large share of each,<br>
Ere its good task to disengage the knot<br>
Be worthily perform'd. &nbsp;From Peter these<br>
I hold, of him instructed, that I err<br>
Rather in opening than in keeping fast;<br>
So but the suppliant at my feet implore."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,<br>
Exclaiming, "Enter, but this warning hear:<br>
He forth again departs who looks behind."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the hinges of that sacred ward<br>
The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,<br>
Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily<br>
Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft<br>
Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss<br>
To leanness doom'd. &nbsp;Attentively I turn'd,<br>
List'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;<br>
And "We praise thee, O God," methought I heard<br>
In accents blended with sweet melody.<br>
The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound<br>
Of choral voices, that in solemn chant<br>
With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,<br>
Come swelling, now float indistinct away.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO X</h2>
<br>

<p>When we had passed the threshold of the gate<br>
(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,<br>
Making the crooked seem the straighter path),<br>
I heard its closing sound. &nbsp;Had mine eyes turn'd,<br>
For that offence what plea might have avail'd?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mounted up the riven rock, that wound<br>
On either side alternate, as the wave<br>
Flies and advances. &nbsp;"Here some little art<br>
Behooves us," said my leader, "that our steps<br>
Observe the varying flexure of the path."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb<br>
The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,<br>
Ere we that strait have threaded. &nbsp;But when free<br>
We came and open, where the mount above<br>
One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,<br>
And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,<br>
Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads<br>
That traverse desert wilds. &nbsp;From whence the brink<br>
Borders upon vacuity, to foot<br>
Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space<br>
Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:<br>
And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,<br>
To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,<br>
That cornice equal in extent appear'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,<br>
When I discover'd that the bank around,<br>
Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,<br>
Was marble white, and so exactly wrought<br>
With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone<br>
Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self<br>
Been sham'd. &nbsp;The angel who came down to earth<br>
With tidings of the peace so many years<br>
Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates<br>
From their long interdict before us seem'd,<br>
In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,<br>
He look'd no silent image. One had sworn<br>
He had said, "Hail!" for she was imag'd there,<br>
By whom the key did open to God's love,<br>
And in her act as sensibly impress<br>
That word, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord,"<br>
As figure seal'd on wax. &nbsp;"Fix not thy mind<br>
On one place only," said the guide belov'd,<br>
Who had me near him on that part where lies<br>
The heart of man. &nbsp;My sight forthwith I turn'd<br>
And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,<br>
Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,<br>
Another story graven on the rock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,<br>
That it might stand more aptly for my view.<br>
There in the self-same marble were engrav'd<br>
The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,<br>
That from unbidden office awes mankind.<br>
Before it came much people; and the whole<br>
Parted in seven quires. &nbsp;One sense cried, "Nay,"<br>
Another, "Yes, they sing." &nbsp;Like doubt arose<br>
Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume<br>
Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.<br>
Preceding the blest vessel, onward came<br>
With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,<br>
Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd<br>
Less and yet more than kingly. &nbsp;Opposite,<br>
At a great palace, from the lattice forth<br>
Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn<br>
And sorrow. &nbsp;To behold the tablet next,<br>
Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,<br>
I mov'd me. &nbsp;There was storied on the rock<br>
The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,<br>
Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn<br>
His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.<br>
A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd<br>
In tears and mourning. &nbsp;Round about them troop'd<br>
Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold<br>
The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/10-74.jpg"><img alt="10-74th.jpg (40K)" src="images/10-74th.jpg" height="476" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:<br>
"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart<br>
My son is murder'd." &nbsp;He replying seem'd;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait now till I return." And she, as one<br>
Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou<br>
Dost not return?"&mdash;"Where I am, who then is,<br>
May right thee."&mdash;"What to thee is other's good,<br>
If thou neglect thy own?"&mdash;"Now comfort thee,"<br>
At length he answers. &nbsp;"It beseemeth well<br>
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:<br>
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd<br>
That visible speaking, new to us and strange<br>
The like not found on earth. &nbsp;Fondly I gaz'd<br>
Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,<br>
Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,<br>
When "Lo," the poet whisper'd, "where this way<br>
(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.<br>
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights<br>
Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! I would not that amaz'd thou miss<br>
Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God<br>
Decrees our debts be cancel'd. &nbsp;Ponder not<br>
The form of suff'ring. &nbsp;Think on what succeeds,<br>
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom<br>
It cannot pass. &nbsp;"Instructor," I began,<br>
"What I see hither tending, bears no trace<br>
Of human semblance, nor of aught beside<br>
That my foil'd sight can guess." &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems<br>
Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first<br>
Struggled as thine. &nbsp;But look intently thither,<br>
An disentangle with thy lab'ring view,<br>
What underneath those stones approacheth: now,<br>
E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians and proud!  O poor and wretched ones!<br>
That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust<br>
Upon unstaid perverseness!  Know ye not<br>
That we are worms, yet made at last to form<br>
The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes<br>
That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?<br>
Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?<br>
Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,<br>
Like the untimely embryon of a worm!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, to support incumbent floor or roof,<br>
For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,<br>
That crumples up its knees unto its breast,<br>
With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd<br>
In the beholder's fancy; so I saw<br>
These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each, as his back was laden, came indeed<br>
Or more or less contract; but it appear'd<br>
As he, who show'd most patience in his look,<br>
Wailing exclaim'd: "I can endure no more."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
